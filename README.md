##Job Description:

```We are currently seeking individuals worldwide who can support our website testing projects. We have two distinct opportunities available for you to participate in, with each providing a unique way to earn income.```

##Project 1 - Computer Borrowing:
```If you have 2 or more computers that can be shared, we are willing to pay 100$/month to borrow them. Safety of your personal information is guaranteed as we only require the use of your computer, nothing else. Our company will connect to your device via Anydesk, therefore stable internet connection is needed, and we prefer computers with 4GB RAM or higher. There are no specifications needed for your system as we will only use Google Chrome. Join us today and turn your idle computer into a money-making machine.```

##Project 2 - Website Tester:
```We are also recruiting website testers, and applicants should send their resumes to our project email. Your resume doesn't require any specific formatting or complex detailing. However, it must contain relevant information like your full name. Upon registration, you will receive a link for KYC verification. Once your identity is verified, you will receive $100, as part of our initiative to test Persona website's new AI engine's match with resumes and IDs.```

```You have the flexibility to apply for either or both of the projects and begin earning immediately. If interested, please reach out directly to us via email for quick and immediate turnaround. Remember, we only accept communications through the mentioned email address and not through the Fiverr platform. ```

##Contact Information:
